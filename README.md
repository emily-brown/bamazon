## App in action: https://asciinema.org/a/f8Rk8NCFflefzTQmLp12vfyh1

## Tools/Lanugages Used:
```
  -- Javascript
  -- Node.js
  -- mySQL
```

## Site Functionality and Features 
```
  - Run the Node application called bamazonCustomer.js. Running this application will first display all of the items available for sale. 
  - The app will then prompt users with two messages. 1. Ask them the ID of the product they would like to buy. 2. Ask how many units of the product they would like to buy.
  - Once the customer has placed the order, your application should check if your store has enough of the product to meet the customer's request.
  - If not, the app will log the phrase Insufficient quantity!, and then prevent the order from going through. The user is then prompted to try again using the list of available inventory.
